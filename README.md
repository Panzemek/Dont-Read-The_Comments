# Don't Read the Comments
This is a simple scraping and Mongodb appliction, allowing the user to scrape the tropes from TVTropes for the video game let's player raocow, then view and comment on them.

## Functionality
Populating the database is accomplished via the /scrape route.  The root route then lets you view the trope pages, click on the tropes, and comment on them into the database.  The api routes then let you see the comments.

## Challenges
Having missed a full day of class, including the entire mongoose section, made this assignment quite difficult.  There was also inconsistency in the data being scraped, and while I was able to clear some of the errors there are a few remaining in the title.  I was also unable in the time available to me to be creative with the formatting or improve the commenting and viewing functionality.  Much of the assignment closely maps to a class activity from the day I missed.
